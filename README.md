# PLCT

Procedural Level Creation Tools (PLCT) for the [Flax Engine](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxEngine). 

This is a simple set of creative tools to allow you to procedurally generate levels with a simple graph tool. This is similar to Unreal Engine's [PCG](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/procedural-content-generation-overview) but is currently much less featured. Feel free to submit PRs and issues if you like the project!
